# Draft Papers (RWOT12)

This directory contains our RWOT12 papers as they were as we closed out the workshop on September 22. Papers will continue to be updated until they are finally published to the final-documents folder in the coming months.

But take a look at what we've done so far!

* [**Beyond DID:Web**](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot12-cologne/blob/main/draft-documents/beyond-did-web.md)
   * Mirko Mollik, Hans Boone, Dan Carez, Jen Schreiber, Dr. Sebastian Schmittner, Dr. Carsten Stoeker

This paper will explore a few recent suggestions for enhancing the did:web method, in particular did:webplus and did:webs. Shortcomings of did:web are analyzed and a list of necessary features to overcome real problems is assembled. We strive to avoid the problem mentioned in the above comic and answer the question, whether the did web method can be improved without creating yet another (few) did methods.

* [**Exchanges through NOSTR for DID Holders**](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot12-cologne/blob/main/draft-documents/Peer_to_peer_credentials_through_NOSTR)
   * Imad El Aouny & Frederic Martin

Nostr is a simple, open protocol that enables global, decentralized, and censorship-resistant social media.

This paper explains how two DID holders can securely :
- establish end to end encrypted communication channels
- exchange credentials
- send and receive text messages
